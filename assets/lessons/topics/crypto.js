    "Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions.",
    "Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.",
    "Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It is a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.",
    "Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.",
    "Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.",
    "If you own cryptocurrency, you do not own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party."
